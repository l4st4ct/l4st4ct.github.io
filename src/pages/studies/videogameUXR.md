## Client
Development, Design teams

## Problem
Development and design teams were not practicing user-centered design and wanted help incorporating methods into their process starting with using personas.

## Role
UX designer

## Challenge

<ul>
    <li>Proto-personas were created the previous year when the teams adopted Agile, but were eventually abandoned.
    </li>
    <li>The teams were using a generic user - Annie - in their user stories. Annie completed all tasks and did not reflect any of the existing user behaviors.
    </li>
</ul>

## Project Details
I worked with the marketing and SEO teams to gather quantitative data on our users and their behaviors. I also worked closely with our UX researcher to gather qualitative data. Casey Skinnell and Amy O'Brien were selected as our primary personas representing either end of our user spectrum. I collaborated well with the design team to create trading cards and posters of our new persona brides. A launch party with games and scenarios were used to introduce the development teams to our personas. A month later developer user stories were found in Pivotal Tracker using at least one of the personas.



<div style="background-color:grey">

## Reflection
Although we monitored story tickets  and saw an increase in using these personas in feature stories, I would have created more defined usage metrics that matched the goals and team needs.
