## New Customer Account MFA Experience Discovery & Proposal 

## Project Overview


New security checks and shopping cart workflows needed to be implemented for Media Temple.  Existing workflows and customer experiences were unclear and required completing primary research to understand customer pain points before offering a solution. The two(2) projects below illustrate the challenges, steps and deliverables.
## Client
Software Development team

## Problem
After several requests from users, the team planned to build new additional security experience for accounts - multi-factor authentication.

## Challenge
The experience was new to the account ecosystem thus no information or metrics were available.

## Actions
Customer Service calls and Customer Service agent interviews were used and processed to understand needs and customer experience. I met with product managers to list the initial requirements and ideal workflow of the new security feature. After doing some competitive research on the authentication process, I created high-fidelity wireframes and a Framerjs prototype. I then proceeded to get feedback from stakeholders, developers, and our users in testing sessions.

## Deliverables
The following were created and shared with stakeholders to start the Phase 1 of the project planning.:

- Workflow charts
- Wireframes

## Tools Used
Omnigraffle, Framerjs

Client

Marketing & Sales teams
Problem

Marketing & Sales teams requested improvements to the shopping cart experience on the website. Shopping Cart abandonment rates were high, inconsistencies with UI elements throughout each step of checkout workflow confused customers increasing customer service calls or lost salesChallengeTracking data was limited and couldn't clearly explain which steps caused friction for the customer. 
Actions

Since quantitative information was limited, customer service agent interviews provided insight to the pain points customers had when making purchases and opening accounts. I also reviewed online chats and phone recordings to understand customer experiences and frustrations within the shopping cart.
Deliverables

To help identify the opportunities for improvement, I created:- journey map of a shopping experience- competitive analysis report of other e-commerce websites- wireframes and InVision prototypes for testing- user testing research plans Based on user testing results we were able to plan phases for improving the different areas for the shopping cart and checkout experience.

Media Temple-Service Overview (page)

Problem
Users didn’t have a way to review all their subscriptions and services. The only way to see this information was via the Request To Close page

Challenge
An API did not exist with this information; Perle and Template Toolkit were the only options available; Google Analytics implementation was limited on RTC page - certain events were not being tracked

Rsearch
In Google Analytics, the Request To Close was in the top 6 pages visited for the past 5 months
Collected user feedback from Customer Service calls
Ran usertesting.com task based test to verify issue with finding their service information
