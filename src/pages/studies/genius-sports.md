# Genius Soorts Media

## Overview

During my time at Genius Sports, I was fortunate enough to work with the Machine Learning team on a new product that used computer vision and camera sensors. My role was to help develop the video interface for users to review the video footage and statistics of each game their team played.

## Problem 
Coaches and team management need an objective way to view the team and player performance to develop strategies and performance improvement plans

## Challenge
• The user and their pain points were not defined
• The product hardware was still in development
• New product and technology so no existing quantitative information was available
• Assumptions of the user were being used so first the definition of who the user was needed to be defined as well as their pain points

## Research

I needed to first understand the problem the Machine Learning team was solving with the AI Tracker product. I  had a couple of sessions with the Product Manager, Commercial team and Product owner to hear their goals, how they imagined the user workflows and roles within the AI Tracker product. Mapping out the sitemap and workflows helped identify potential opportunities for users as well as areas needed to investigate and validate in later user testing.
I worked with our research team to interview university basketball team coaches and management to learn about top tasks when working with their teams and building game strategies. 

The interviews with coaches - the primary users for this product - provided direction on the current taxonomy that was being used and helped evaluate certain modules that were originally assumed to be valuable within the product hardware and web interface.

## Design

Coaches are not the only ones involved in designing team or individual players performance plan. Identifying the top tasks for each team manager based on their role prompted a need for at least 2 different workspaces and account privileges.

With this information, rough paper sketches were made along with some competitive research.

## Outcome

An update to a second round of interactive InVision wireframes were produced and updates were made to labels. 
Before I left, a second round of interviews were being arranged to test out a high fidelity version on the AI Tracker interface.
