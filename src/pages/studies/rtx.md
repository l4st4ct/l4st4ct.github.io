## ADX Program - Evaluated Migration Experience and Learning Center Website

## Oveerview

The ADX Program was planned for 40,000+ employees to manually migrate their account profiles and computers to another network domain by running a program with the help of a Microsoft program. Employees in each business unit were scheduled to migrate from June 2023 through December 2024.  An intranet website - the ADX Migration Learning Center - was created to educate employees about the migration process and serve as a resource center

## Problem

## Challenge 

There was an increase of employees reporting issues during and post-migration since August 2023. The goal was to decrease help desk tickets and offer better  resources for employees to troubleshoot post-migration issues.
