## Project Name

## Overview
The Maji Safi Group was looking for recommendations to improve their website and increase volunteers for their community events in Colorado and Tanzania. I conducted a website audit and presented a list of recommendations to improve their messaging and visual design of their website.

## Problem
The Maji Safi Group knew the content was outdated on their website and they’re mission was poorly communicated on their website. Their number of volunteers were also in decline. They relied on their volunteers to support community events.

## Challenge
• There were no website analytics
• The original WordPress developer and webmaster left a year before, taking any knowledge of the site and its setup with him
• The project stakeholders were often traveling between Colorado and Tanzania
