# Overview

## Reflection
p
As a response to 2025 events and all my different services I’m signed up to having end of year look backs and data reports, ayout.plus give myself a design project to improve design and l.I created my own. With the spirit of the quantified self movement and the Feltron Report I created the “EOY-WTF Readout 2025” I only had 2 days left before the new year, and for added pressure I had to share on social media - my choice BluSky and Instagram. 
When I’m experiencing the heaviness of life and don’t have the words, I turn towards art, give myself a project to do, to think through the chaos, confusion and pain; problem solve creatively and still find joy with the creating process.

My Readout version 1

Some areas I want to rework:
The images I want to desaturate, use a tint of 1 color or use grayscale
Definitely use a different body type and styling
Use a different type for the EOY-WTF Report 2025
Include links to completed projects, classes
Craft plan to make this accessible, digitally, and as a pdf

Plan a complementary website

Also this has been a fun way to reflect on the year. What follows my interests? What I value? Am I putting my values in practice? How if so?
