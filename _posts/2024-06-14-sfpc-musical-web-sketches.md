Listing my sketches from the musical web class here and with some reflections 
<!-- summary -->


Week 1 [some laughs](https://lissa-remix-musicweb.glitch.me/)<br/>
<p>should I animate the image? or maybe just focus on the current animating and laugher, the image is just a reference no need to be incorporated in this new piece - the contrast between stillness and laughter/movement is the focus</p>

Week 2 [claudia's trip to space](https://musicalweb-wk3.glitch.me/)<br/>
<p>thoughts about time - what is it? how does it encapsulate change - and  painting a moment and characters with sound. thinking how I can recreate and push this feeling and create a robust rich picture of space and adventure</p>
Week 3 [rnbo remix](https://musicalweb-rnbo-remix.glitch.me)<br/>
