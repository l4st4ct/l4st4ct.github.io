It's a nervous energy, I'm shaking. What i this feeling? Not fear. No desire to run away but to dive right in. Who's gonna stop me? Its a new way to see the world - to understand my world? Its too late now...can't unsee it...

Well geormetry and trigonometry were fun - I'm an art kid so anything with shapes had my attention, and when the formulas were getting too much - sine,cosine why? - there was a reason to bring out my ti-89...and play space invaders...
